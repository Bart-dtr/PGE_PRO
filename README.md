PGE PRO Description
The report focuses on speedway racing, but its main purpose is to showcase my skills in data analysis and visualization in Power BI.
The techniques applied in this report can easily be adapted to financial data or other industry-specific applications.
The report consists of two fully interactive sections:
â€¢	Home Dashboard â€“ Provides key insights into the league, teams, their performance, and stadium attendance.
â€¢	Best/Worst Riders Dashboard â€“ Delves into detailed statistics about individual riders.
While working on this project, I had the opportunity to enhance my skills right from the data acquisition stage. The data was available as a web resource, so I used Power Query to extract and transform the data into a functional CSV format, employing ETL methodology.
The next step was to load the data into SQL Server to enable DirectQuery connectivity, ensuring the report's performance and up-to-date nature.
Using SQL, I created documentation to validate the numbers displayed in Power BI. With DAX, I implemented advanced analyses, such as percentage shares and real-time data filtering, allowing for flexible and tailored insights. Additionally, the report's interactivity enables users to view data from various perspectives â€“ from an all-time league overview down to specific years or teams.
This project was an amazing opportunity to combine theory with practice and develop my analytical skills in reporting and data visualization using Power BI ðŸ™‚
